Background:
Great savory vegan gravy. Perfect for thanksgiving!

Ingredients:
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/3 cup canola oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme (or 1 tsp. dried)
2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage (or 1 tsp. dried)
4 cups water
1/4 cup tamari (or Nama Shoyu or other quality unpasteurized soy sauce)
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper

Instructions:
1. Stir the nutritional year and flour in a heavy skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes or
    until fragrant. Set aside.

2. Heat the oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat.
    Add the onion and saute for 10 minutes or until tender and beginning to turn brown.

3. Add the garlic, thyme and sage for 30 seconds or until fragrant.

4. Whisk in the flour mixture thoroughly and then whisk in the water, tamari, salt and pepper.

5. Bring to a simmer, whisking frequently and continue to simmer until the gravy is thick and
    creamy. You can strain the gravy if you like or toss it in the blender for a minute or so,
    to get it smooth. (However, it tastes great even without straining!).

6. The gravy will keep for 2 - 3 days, covered and refrigerated.
