# Original recipe from https://thecheekychickpea.com/cauliflower-buffalo-wings/

Background:
These Vegan Cauliflower Buffalo Wings are baked not fried, super crispy, and gluten free.
They’re the perfect spicy appetizer or snack for game day or any day!
Made with Frank’s Red Hot Buffalo sauce!

Ingredients:
1 medium-large head of cauliflower

for the batter:
1 cup rice flour
1 cup almond milk, unsweetened
1 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
pinch of pepper

for the sauce:
1 cup Frank’s Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce
2 teaspoons vegan Worcestershire sauce, I like the ‘Wizard’s‘ brand or  ‘Annie’s’
1 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 tablespoon maple syrup

Instructions:
1. Pre Heat oven to 425°
2. Wash and core the cauliflower.
	Then pull apart some of the florets and chop some as well.
	You want bite size pieces. Roughly the size of a golf ball or a little smaller.

3. Next, in a large bowl whisk the batter ingredients until smooth and add the cauliflower pieces
	and mix well, so all the pieces are completely coated in the batter.

4. Now place the pieces one by one on a large parchment lined baking sheet
	and bake for 25 minutes. No flipping necessary.

5. While they’re baking mix up the hot sauce ingredients, (except the maple syrup)
	and reserve 1/3 cup of the sauce for dipping and mix in the maple syrup.

6. After 25 minutes remove from the oven and add the cauliflower to a large mixing bowl.
	Pour the hot sauce (not the reserved sauce) over the cauliflower and mix
	until all the pieces are coated.

7. Return the cauliflower to the oven for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway through.

8. Serve right away with the reserved Buffalo hot sauce and my Vegan ranch Dressing. Enjoy!
