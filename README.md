# recipe-book
## A collection of our favorite recipes.
- Summer and I will come across recipes that we either want to try, or do try, and I thought it would be nice to keep them in a single, easily accessible place.
- We also talk about edits and other stuff we would do differently to recipes on the next iteration and this seems like a convenient way to track changes and updates!

#### Recipe version control thoughts... these might change.
- ~~Trial updates to recipes could start out in their own branches and then become merged into `master` once we've found an update we are happy with.~~
- `recipe-book` is the current working versions of recipes and all updates will be merged here. If there are alternate working versions of recipes, they will live in their own branches and be merged to `recipe-book` when they have become our "official" orientation.

#### If the "book" starts to fill with recipes and the root folder becomes too unwieldy, we might separate recipes out into grouped directories.
