# recipe-book
## A collection of our favorite recipes.
- Summer and I will come across recipes that we either want to try, or do try, and I thought it would be nice to keep them in a single, easily accessible place.
- We also talk about edits that we would make to recipes and this seems like a convenient way to track changes and updates!

#### If the "book" starts to fill with recipes and the root folder becomes to unweildy, I might separate recipes out into folders.
