# recipe-book
## A collection of our favorite recipes.
- Summer and I will come across recipes that we either want to try, or do try, and I thought it would be nice to keep them in a single, easily accessible place.
- We also talk about edits and other stuff we would do differently to recipes on the next iteration and this seems like a convenient way to track changes and updates!

#### Recipe version control thoughts... these might change.
- I think it would make sense to keep original versions of recipes in the `master` branch.
- Trial updates to recipes could start out in their own branches and then become merged into "official" update branches where they can live.

#### If the "book" starts to fill with recipes and the root folder becomes to unweildy, I might separate recipes out into folders.
