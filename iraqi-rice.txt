# Recipe from Aunt Mindy

Background:
Mindy has been making this recipe longer than I've been alive
and it has a nostalgic component to it for sure. It's simple to make, but amazingly delicious!

Ingredients:
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1-1/2 cups water
1 cup jasmine or basmati rice
1 cup yellow onion, chopped
8 oz. non-spiced tomato sauce (usually half a can)

Instructions:
1. Heat oil over medium heat in the bottom of a non-stick pot and add onions.
	Cook until onions start to brown and become fragrant.

2. Wash rice under cool water until the water drains clear.
	To the pot of onions add:
	a. rice
	b. water
	c. tomato sauce
	and stir.

3. Reduce heat to low and cover. Leave covered for ~20 min.

4. Keep covered as much as possible until rice is fully cooked with a nice crispy layer on bottom.
