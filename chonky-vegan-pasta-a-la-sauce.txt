# This is one we made up!

Background:
Seemed like a good idea at the time. We used broth-based sauce and thickening techniques from
the mapo tofu recipe.

Ingredients:
3 tbsps coconut or vegetable oil
1 Cup of chopped cauliflower
Half an orange bell pepper chopped
Half cup onion chopped
1 small sweet potato, thin slices
3 cloves garlic minced
2 sausages (tofurkey/field roast, preferably)

Can of diced tomatoes
12 oz. veggie broth (vegetable or no-chicken bouillon)
2 tablespoons corn starch

Shake of Thyme
2 shakes cumin
1 bay leaf
Several hearty shakes of Nutritional yeast

Pasta (1-2 cups, dried)
Serve with a dollop of tahini

Instructions:
	1.	Start pasta
	2.	Cut up veggies
	3.	Throw in an oily saucepan on medium heat in this order:
		a.	Onion
		b.	Garlic
		c.	Potato
		d.	Sausage
		e.	Cauliflower
		f.	Bell pepper
	4.	Cook until things start to brown and garlic becomes fragrant (~5-8 min)
	5.	Add stewed tomatoes and cook for 1 min
	6.	Add broth and corn starch and stir thoroughly
	7.	Add nooch and spices, crank heat to high, and cook until sauce is slightly thick
		(another ~5 min), stirring occasionally... reduce heat to medium when sauce has thickened
	8.	When pasta is cooked to your liking, drain it and stir into the sauce
	9.	To serve, add and mix in a dollop of tahini and papalote or other hot sauce
