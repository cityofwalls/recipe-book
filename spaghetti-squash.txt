Background:
This is my go-to method for creating perfect al dente spaghetti squash strands to use in vegetable
sides and main dishes. The exact timing will vary depending on the heat of your oven and the
size of your squash.

Author: Jeanine Donofrio
Serves: 2 to 4

Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash
extra-virgin olive oil
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.

2. Slice the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds and ribbing.
	Drizzle the inside of the squash with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

3. Place the spaghetti squash cut side down on the baking sheet and use a fork to poke holes.
	Roast for 30 to 40 minutes or until lightly browned on the outside, fork tender,
	but still a little bit firm. The time will vary depending on the size of your squash.
	I also find that the timing can vary from squash to squash.

4. Remove from the oven and flip the squash so that it’s cut side up. When cool to the touch,
	use a fork to scrape and fluff the strands from the sides of the squash.
