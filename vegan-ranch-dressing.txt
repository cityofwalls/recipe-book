Background:
5 Minute Vegan Ranch Dressing! This is the Best Vegan Ranch Dressing and so easy to make at home,
with vegan mayonnaise and a few ingredients you have a delicious vegan salad dressing or dip,
and it’s ready in 5 minutes! It’s creamy, tangy, dairy free and egg free!

Ingredients:
1 cup vegan mayonnaise (e.g. Vegennaise)
2 teaspoons dried dill or 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped dill
1 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4–1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt or regular salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 and 1/2 tablespoons dill pickle juice
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

Instructions:
1. Add all ingredients to a small bowl ( I usually use a soup bowl) and whisk until combined.

2. Serve right away or let the dressing chill in the fridge for 30 minutes,
    so the flavours develop even more.

3. Enjoy as a dip with veggies, potato chips, pizza or French fries ( my favourite?).
    It is also delicious as a salad dressing, and sandwich spread too!
